Welcome to the start of a new blog about a game I'm developing: *Faeroots* (working title). *Faeroots* is a dicepool TTRPG with a difficulty check system, where you start with 2d6 in your pool, but can add your skills and items for extra dice. 
The game should be very swingy and quite difficult, with Armor Class ratings of great monsters sometimes even beyond 12. The usual armor class of a human is 5 though (without armor). 
Skills should be very narrow in this game, and are more things you learn in an evening of work than training for years. 
Human Magic is based on superstitions in the real world, and reagent based. There are no real spells (though I am thinking of adding chalk drawings as ritual magic). It's more that garlic fends of vampires, and moonlight enrages wolfs.
Fae Magic (which you won't be able to play) has long and winding nature rituals
The game is suposed to cater for one-shots, but have an ongoing realm to manage for a GM. Because I like playing with different groups, but keeping the same world. At the end of the session, the party will be asked to leave a mark on the world.

I wanted to dedicate this post to explaining the history of the world in the setting of *Faeroots*. The premise is that through the pact of Fae with Humans, the World Tree, that all Fae are connected to and grants eternal life and magic to them, grows abundant and thrives. The roots of the world tree have been spreading through the earth because of this, and are causing chaos by the creatures that live underneath. Something is driving the Goblins to the surface, and the Goblins that come on the surface drive the Beastmen into the Human Kingdoms. The Fae know and help with fighting off this chaos, but won't speak about the cause.
This, the players (and most humans) are all ignorant about. They only know of the Beastmen attacking their villages, and sometimes a rare Goblin on the surface. They praise their pact with the Fae and fight back the evils that come. 
After every session, the adventurers build a memory of themselves in the realm so other parties in coming sessions see traces of their work. There is a system of prestige and crave where your actions might be remembered through generations.
Because every session will be played with a time skip. I'm not sure yet if it will be 10 years or 40 years, but it will be many years before the next adventurers come. 

Here is an overview of the history of the world:
**30.000 years ago** Humans emerge
**25.000 years ago** a group of Humans find the World Tree. They pledge themselves to its magic, and become Fae by giving up their humanity and are granted eternal life by giving their past.
**10.000 years ago** Humans start to thrive and the Fae magically create Beastmen to keep Humans in check.
**2.000 years ago** Beastmen almost wipe out the Humans, and the Fae form a pact with the Humans to slay Beastmen. 
**Now** the World Tree is tended well, and grows abundant. Magic flows through the Fae, and the roots are spreading though the Earth. It pushes others up, who have lived comfortably under the soil for eternities. The Fae, still in a pact with the Humans, fight these beings, but will never turn on their World Tree, or even speak about it. 

**Possible future:** When the Beastmen, and the Groundlings (Goblins and others) are defeated, the Fae will surely turn on the Humans, and will be the only ones left on the planet.

So yeah, this is the idea behind my setting. The setting should be pretty local, around the town of Idylle, about 300 years after Turn of the Leaves. I've tried to write a setting like this for ages. First I named it *Everfall* and then *The Nature of Things*, but now I will go for *Faeroots*  as a working title. I'm excited to see where this goes.

Have a great day, Caelin
